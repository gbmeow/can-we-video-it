### Core concept that i did not understand 
1. How to access the sorted part of the array?
* By iterating from the back of the sorted array - `for (let j = sorted.length; j >= 0; j--)`
2. How to use iteration to modify specific parts of the array
* Move forward to iterate through all elements in the array `for (let i = 1; i < cards.length; i++) {`
* Move backwords on the sorted array for (let j = sorted.length; j >= 0; j--)`
* Make space in the original array `cards[j + 1] = temp;`
